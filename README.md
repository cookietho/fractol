# fractol
##### The goal of this project is to create a program that creates and optimizes a visualized mathematical object called a fractal. Fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar pattern whatever the scale. 

##  Mandatory Part
##### Your program cannot have memory leaks.
##### You cannot use global variables.
##### Your project must follow the Norm.
##### Your Makefile must compile the project and must contain the usual rules. It must not recompile and re-link the program unless necessary.
##### You must use the miniLibX.
##### Your software should offer at least 3 different types of fractals.
##### It must be possible to make the parameter of the Julia set vary only with the mouse (without clicking).

## Bonus Part
##### The zoom follow the actual mouse position.
##### In addition to the zoom: moving with the arrows.
##### Make the color range shift.
##### Multi-threading implementation.
##### Two valid parameters in the command line, resulting in two fractals in two windows.
