# fractol
##### The goal of this project is to greate a program that creates and optimizes a visualized mathematical object called a fractal. Fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar pattern whatever the scale. 

##  Mandatory Part
##### Your program cannot have memory leaks.
##### You cannot use global variables.
##### Your project must follow the Norm.
##### Your Makefile must compile the project and must contain the usual rules. It must not recompile and re-link the program unless necessary.
##### You must use the miniLibX.
##### Your software should offer at least 3 different types of fractals.
##### It must be possible to make the parameter of the Julia set vary only with the mouse (without clicking).
##### 
## Bonus Part
##### 
##  How to use
##### 1.git clone 
##### 2.cd to fractol directory
##### 3.run make to compile a nd link the sources
##### 4.make will create an excutable file called fractol
##### 5.excution: ./fractol Set name
